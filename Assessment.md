## Introduction

The PHP Laravel coding assignment with the purpose of testing the proficiency of developers who applies to Jitera.

All applicants are required to submit the assignment on time with a high standard and cleaning code.

## Before having testing

Your code should be clean, and our checkpoints are

- Looks clean code or not
- Understanding architecture or not
- Logic looks smart and matches request or not
- Following the best practices of PHP Laravel
- Following the basic engineering practice. Good documentation and comment are examples.

## Requirements

- The assignment only requires work on the Backend side, no frontend development is required
- Create ‚Äúusers‚Äù table and GET API to return users.
    - Example API response: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
- Create backend logic including database architecture and API endpoints to follow and unfollow users. Users should be able to follow other users.
- Create an API endpoint to be able to search followers by name. This API is for the list of followers screen, and the user can filter followers by name.
- Unit testing is a plus point
- Deployment to any host or cloud is a plus point
